## 1) What are S3 Storage Classes?

In **Amazon S3**, **storage classes** define:

* **How frequently data is accessed**
* **How much storage costs**
* **How fast you can retrieve data**
* **How durable & available the data is**

**Data stays in the same bucket**, only the **storage class changes**.

---

## 2) S3 Storage Classes (One by One with Use Cases)

### 2.1 S3 Standard

**Default storage class**

**Characteristics**

* Designed for **frequently accessed data**
* High durability (99.999999999%)
* Low latency, high throughput
* Stored across multiple AZs

**Real-time use cases**

* Web application images & videos
* Static website hosting
* Mobile & web app assets
* API responses
* Active application data

**Example**

```
Production website images
User profile photos
Application uploads
```

---

### 2.2 S3 Intelligent-Tiering

**Automatically moves data based on access pattern**

**Characteristics**

* Monitors access patterns
* Automatically moves data to cheaper tiers
* Small monthly monitoring fee
* No retrieval delay

**Access tiers inside**

* Frequent Access
* Infrequent Access
* Archive Instant
* Archive
* Deep Archive

**Real-time use cases**

* Data with **unknown or changing access patterns**
* SaaS application uploads
* Shared enterprise data

**Example**

```
User uploaded documents
Logs accessed randomly
Reports used occasionally
```

---

### 2.3 S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)

**Characteristics**

* For data accessed **less frequently**
* Lower storage cost than Standard
* Retrieval fee applies
* Stored across multiple AZs

**Real-time use cases**

* Monthly reports
* Backup copies
* Disaster recovery data
* Older application data

**Example**

```
Database backups (monthly)
Archived invoices
Audit reports
```

---

### 2.4 S3 One Zone-IA

**Characteristics**

* Data stored in **single AZ**
* Cheaper than Standard-IA
* Slightly lower availability
* Retrieval fee applies

**Real-time use cases**

* Re-creatable data
* Secondary backups
* Temporary datasets

**Example**

```
Processed logs
Derived analytics data
Temporary backup copies
```

---

### 2.5 S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

**Characteristics**

* Archive data
* Millisecond retrieval
* Cheaper than Standard-IA
* Retrieval fee applies

**Real-time use cases**

* Archived data that still needs fast access
* Compliance data
* Medical records (recent archive)

**Example**

```
Last year compliance documents
Archived HR records
```

---

### 2.6 S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (Earlier: Glacier)

**Characteristics**

* Very low storage cost
* Retrieval time: minutes to hours
* Good for long-term archives

**Retrieval options**

* Expedited (1–5 mins)
* Standard (3–5 hours)
* Bulk (5–12 hours)

**Real-time use cases**

* Long-term backups
* Legal data
* Audit trails

**Example**

```
5–7 years old logs
Tax records
Historical system backups
```

---

### 2.7 S3 Glacier Deep Archive

**Cheapest storage in AWS**

**Characteristics**

* Lowest storage cost
* Retrieval time: **12–48 hours**
* For data rarely accessed

**Real-time use cases**

* Regulatory retention (7–10 years)
* Legal compliance
* Old medical or financial data

**Example**

```
Banking records (10 years)
Government compliance data
Old CCTV footage
```

## 3) Quick Comparison (Teaching Summary)

| Storage Class       | Access Speed  | Cost           | Best For            |
| ------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| Standard            | Immediate     | Highest        | Active data         |
| Intelligent-Tiering | Immediate     | Auto-optimized | Unknown patterns    |
| Standard-IA         | Immediate     | Lower          | Monthly/rare access |
| One Zone-IA         | Immediate     | Cheaper        | Re-creatable data   |
| Glacier Instant     | Immediate     | Low            | Archived but fast   |
| Glacier Flexible    | Minutes–Hours | Very Low       | Long-term archive   |
| Deep Archive        | Hours–Days    | Cheapest       | Compliance storage  |

## 4) AWS S3 Free Tier Limits (Very Important)

### 4.1 S3 Free Tier (First 12 Months)

AWS Free Tier includes:

**Storage**

* **5 GB** of **S3 Standard storage**

**Requests**

* **20,000 GET requests**
* **2,000 PUT requests**

**Data Transfer**

* **15 GB data transfer out to Internet**

**Important**

* Free tier applies **only to S3 Standard**
* Other storage classes are **not free**

---

### 4.2 What happens after free tier?

* Charges apply **per GB stored**
* Charges apply for:

  * Requests
  * Retrievals (IA & Glacier)
  * Data transfer out

 This is why **lifecycle policies** are used to control cost.

---

## 5) Real-World Best Practice to Explain

### Lifecycle policy example

```
Day 0    → S3 Standard
Day 30   → S3 Standard-IA
Day 90   → S3 Glacier
Day 365  → S3 Deep Archive
```

**Use case**

* Application logs
* Compliance data
* Backup strategies

---

## 6) Simple Line to Remember (for explanation)

> “S3 storage classes help us balance **cost vs access speed**.
> Frequently accessed data stays in Standard, rarely accessed data moves to Glacier or Deep Archive automatically using lifecycle rules.”
